## Research Description

The analysis will examine how a country's Human Development Index (HDI) rank and years of schooling influence the prevalence of commonly used passwords worldwide. Additionally, it will explore the hypothesis that individuals from countries with lower Gross National Income (GNI) tend to use less secure passwords compared to those from higher GNI countries.

### Data Sources

Data for this analysis has been sourced from two key references:

- List of the Top 200 most common passwords: [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/)
- Human Development Index (HDI) data from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) website: [UNDP](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI)
